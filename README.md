# Smart-Waste-Classification-System
Smart Waste Classification System is an intelligent hardware project integrating Machine Learning and Arduino. An ultrasonic sensor detects incoming waste, while a camera captures an image that is analyzed using a ResNet50 model to classify it as plastic or metal. Based on the prediction, a conveyor belt mechanism automatically sorts the waste into the correct bin, enabling efficient, automated, and eco-friendly waste management.

# Wastepy_Waste_Sorting_Using_ML_And_IoT
This project implements an AI-powered waste-sorting conveyor belt system that classifies and separates metal and plastic waste using a ResNet50 deep learning model. An ultrasonic sensor detects the object, triggers a camera to capture an image, and the image is processed on a PC to determine the waste type. Based on the classification, an Arduino-controlled conveyor belt sorts the object into the appropriate bin (left for plastic, right for metal). This system improves recycling accuracy, reduces manual effort, and can be scaled for industrial or municipal waste management applications. Future upgrades may include IoT integration for real-time monitoring.
